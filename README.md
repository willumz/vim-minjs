# vim-minjs

**NOTE:** This is not yet functional and should not be used.

Provides a simple vim object which can be fed keystrokes and update a string variable with the Vim-processed result.

Please note that there is no intention for this package to implement all of Vim's features (hence the `min` in the name, for minimal).  
This package is designed with minimal use cases where vim navigation and alteration of text is required, without the advanced functionality like
commands, macros, etc.
